# FMCG-SUPPLY-CHAIN-MANAGEMENT

The analysis is done for the supply chain domain of 'AtliQ Mart,' an FMCG company, where the no. of customers renewing the contract is decreasing. The company is present in Vadodara, Surat, and Ahmedabad city and sells its various products in the Dairy, Food, and Beverages Categories. And the stakeholders are the director and head of the supply chain of 'AtliQ Mart.'
##  Problem Statement


### Background


AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next two years.


### Challenge


AtliQ Mart is facing a problem where a few key customers still need to extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in total over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %,’ ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and On Time in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders daily against the target service level set for each customer.


## My Task


Assuming I am the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined AtliQ Mart recently, I have been briefed about the task in the stakeholder business review meeting.

So now I am excited to take on this challenge and build this dashboard and perform the following task:

- Create the metrics according to the metrics list.
- Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting.
- Generate relevant insights not offered in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.
